        <h1>Tennis</h1>

   <br> My favourite sport is Tennis. Tennis is a game played with two opposing players(singles)
    or pairs of players (doubles) using tautly strung rackets to hit a ball of specified size, weight,and bounceover a net on a rectangular court.
    Points are awarded to a player or team whenever the opponent fails to correctly return the ball within the prescribed
    dimensions of the court. Organized tennis is played acording to rules sanctioned by the International
    tennis Federation(ITF), the world governing body of the sport.<br>


    <br><li>MY FAVOURITE PLAYERS:</li>
         
    <li>Sania Mirza</li>
    <li>Novak Djokovic</li>
    <li>Jao Fonseca</li>
