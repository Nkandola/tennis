   <h1>Tennis?</h1>
   
   
   
   
    Whether you're a tennis beginner or an advanced player, tennis is a physically taxing sport that requires every muscle group of your body working in tandem for long periods.
     Tennis is also a mental game, requiring players to think quickly and decide which is the best shot they"re going to use to win the point.
     The more you practice the tennis fundamentals, the more you can hone your abilities as a tennis player and improve your game exponentially.

     Why Play Tennis?
Playing tennis provides many benefits to both your mind and body. It improves your hand-eye coordination, balance, and agility. Like most rigorous physical activity,
the footwork and upper body movement involved in tennis can help keep you healthy and in shape and reduce stress. Tennis techniques require quick thinking and strategizing,
improving your problem-solving skills and critical thinking—like when to time your split-step from the ready position, how to shift your body weight, when to hit cross-court
or down the line, or when to go for an overhead smash.

Along with these benefits, tennis requires at least two players for a match, which means it also trains your social skills, and if you’re playing doubles, your teamwork skills.
